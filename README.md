# WeatherDashboard

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.1.

## What is it?

This is a weather App built using TypeScript, Angular, Tailwind.css, Preline UI, RxJS, Jasmine and Karma.

## Why did I build it?

I built this as a good excuse to learn unit testing in Angular.

## What problem does it solve?

Allows users to check the weather for a particular location and also save their favourite locations to local storage.

## What did I learn?

I learnt about unit testing in Angular and also that there are ways to write code so that it makes the process of unit testing easier which I will keep in mind for future projects.

## Features

- Able to save locations to local storage

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
