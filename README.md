# WeatherDashboard

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.1.

## What is it?

This is a weather App built using TypeScript, Angular, Tailwind.css, Preline UI, RxJS, Jasmine and Karma. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API on the backend and the app itself is hosted on Netlify.

## Challenges

The main challenge I faced with this project was familiarising myself with Unit testing in Angular. Thankfully their documentation for testing is good and anything not covered there was found with a google search. It's something I want to improve on and add to future projects. 

## Features

- Able to save favourite locations to local storage
- Can search through a dataset of 1000's of cities
- Unit tests using the Jasmine framework

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
